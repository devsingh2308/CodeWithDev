    <h2>Master the Foundations of Programming with C</h2>

    <p>
      C is one of the most influential programming languages in computer science. Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C laid the groundwork for many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python. Its speed, simplicity, and power make it a go-to choice for systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      This tutorial is a comprehensive guide to learning C from the ground up. Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, you'll find clear explanations, real-world examples, and practical exercises in each section.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll start with the basics—understanding the structure of a C program, compiling code using a C compiler (like GCC), and learning how to write your first "Hello, World!" program. The tutorial gradually introduces new concepts to build your confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Variables, data types, and operators are the core of any programming language, and you'll learn how to use them effectively in C. You'll explore integers, floats, characters, and even how to manipulate bits using bitwise operators.
    </p>

    <p>
      Control flow statements such as `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops like `while`, `for`, and `do-while` are thoroughly explained with flowcharts and examples to help you understand logic building.
    </p>

    <p>
      Functions play a central role in writing modular and reusable code. You’ll learn how to define, declare, and call functions, as well as how to use recursion, a key concept in algorithm design.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of C's most powerful features is its pointer system. This tutorial explains pointers in detail—what they are, how they work, and why they're so crucial in C. You'll learn about pointer arithmetic, pointers to functions, and dynamic memory allocation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arrays, strings, and structures are covered thoroughly. You’ll practice manipulating data in memory and using `struct` to group related variables under one name. This helps build complex data models.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll learn how to create and manage files in C using file I/O functions such as `fopen()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, and `fclose()`. This opens the door to building data-driven programs that save and retrieve user data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tutorial explores common libraries like `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, and `string.h`, and teaches how to use them effectively in your projects. You'll understand how to manipulate strings, generate random numbers, sort arrays, and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Error handling, debugging with `gdb`, and understanding segmentation faults are included to help you become a better C developer. You’ll learn how to write safer, more reliable code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advanced topics such as memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, `free`), the stack vs. heap, and function pointers will give you a deeper insight into how C manages resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      C is also used in game development, firmware, operating system kernels, and real-time applications. The tutorial touches on how C is used in the Linux kernel and how you can write performance-critical parts of applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      With exercises, quizzes, and mini-projects such as creating calculators, games, and file converters, you’ll practice what you learn and see how concepts connect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, building your own software, or aiming for embedded system roles, mastering C is a step in the right direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start your journey into the world of C programming and unlock the foundation for becoming a strong software engineer or systems programmer.
