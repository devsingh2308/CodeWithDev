    <h2>Learn PHP - The Server-Side Scripting Language Powering the Web</h2>

    <p>
      PHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open-source server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It powers over 75% of websites, including platforms like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia.
    </p>

    <p>
      This tutorial introduces you to the foundational concepts of PHP, starting with simple scripts that run on your server to generate dynamic HTML pages. You'll learn how to embed PHP into HTML and understand how server-side rendering works.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll explore PHP syntax, variables, data types, operators, control structures, loops, and functions. Each concept is explained with real-world examples and clear code snippets to reinforce your understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      PHP shines in its ability to interact with databases. This tutorial teaches you how to use MySQL or MariaDB to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently using PHP’s PDO or MySQLi extensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      From building contact forms to full-fledged content management systems, you'll learn to handle user input securely using validation and sanitization techniques that protect against XSS and SQL injection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tutorial dives into advanced concepts such as sessions and cookies, enabling you to build user login systems, shopping carts, and personalized dashboards that maintain state across pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll also explore file handling in PHP—reading, writing, and uploading files using built-in functions that help you manage server resources effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you progress, you’ll build real-world mini-projects like guest books, login portals, and admin panels to cement your understanding of PHP's practical uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      PHP supports object-oriented programming (OOP), and this tutorial walks you through creating classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and interfaces—key concepts for scalable, modular code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The course also covers PHP’s interaction with APIs, enabling you to consume and build RESTful services. You'll learn how to work with cURL and JSON to fetch external data and send data from your PHP applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll become proficient in error handling, debugging, and using tools like `var_dump()`, `print_r()`, and custom logging to write clean, bug-free code.
    </p>

    <p>
      PHP’s vast ecosystem includes frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and Symfony. This tutorial provides a stepping stone for diving into these frameworks once you’ve mastered the basics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deploying PHP applications is straightforward. You’ll learn how to host your PHP websites using shared hosting, local servers like XAMPP/WAMP, and cloud platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re a beginner building your first website or a developer looking to add backend logic to your front-end projects, PHP offers a fast, flexible, and pragmatic solution for building dynamic web apps.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the confidence to develop full-stack PHP web applications, connect them to databases, handle user authentication, and deploy them for real-world use.
