    <h2>Learn Java Programming from Scratch</h2>

    <p>
      Java is one of the most popular, versatile, and powerful programming languages in the world. It’s used to build everything from desktop applications to mobile apps, large-scale enterprise systems, and even games.
    </p>

    <p>
      This tutorial series is designed to take you from a complete beginner to a confident Java developer. You will start with the fundamentals: setting up your development environment, writing your first Java program, and understanding the syntax and structure of the language.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll learn about data types, variables, operators, loops, conditionals, and how to control the flow of your program. As you progress, you’ll dive into object-oriented programming (OOP) — a key strength of Java — where you will understand concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tutorial also covers essential Java features such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Arrays and Collections (List, Set, Map)</li>
        <li>Exception handling and debugging</li>
        <li>File handling and input/output streams</li>
        <li>Multithreading and concurrency</li>
        <li>JavaFX for GUI-based applications</li>
        <li>Networking and socket programming</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Java’s platform independence (write once, run anywhere) is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making your skills relevant across various platforms and industries.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll also explore Java development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Maven, and get introduced to build automation and testing with JUnit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're interested in Android development, enterprise backend systems with Spring Boot, or simply building robust standalone applications, Java provides a strong foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CodeWithHarry Java Tutorial is practical and hands-on. You’ll build real-world projects to reinforce what you've learned and gain confidence in applying your knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Java is consistently among the top in-demand languages in the job market. Mastering Java not only enhances your resume but also builds a strong foundation to learn other languages like Kotlin, Scala, or Groovy.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, if you're serious about programming, Java is a must-know language. Whether you're a student, aspiring developer, or someone switching careers, this course will guide you every step of the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s start your journey toward becoming a Java developer!
